#
# History. This guard lived twice, inline, in two jobs of the CI workflow, with the pattern
# written out in both. It is here, once, so the two copies cannot drift; nothing else changed
# about it. The properties it has to keep, each earned by a finding:
#
#   * The pattern appears EXACTLY ONCE, on the definition line below.
#   * The pattern is SELF-NON-MATCHING: every alternative brackets one of its own characters
#     (or escapes a dot), so the definition line is text the pattern does not match. This
#     script is a file in the tree and --tree reads it like any other, with no exemption.
#   * There is NO content-marker exemption, and no file- or path-level exemption for this
#     script. An earlier version let any line claim exemption by carrying a fixed marker
#     string, so a forbidden reference carrying that same string passed unchanged.
#   * `git grep --text` on the tree: whether a file is "binary" is decided by .gitattributes,
#     which the same commit that adds a forbidden reference can also edit, and `git grep -I`
#     never matches a binary file. --text forces every path to be read as text.
#   * The machine-path half covers a developer laptop, a hosted Linux runner, the Linux
#     superuser home and a Windows drive-letter user path, not just one of them.
#   * The jar side loops over EVERY jar in a module's target/, the main jar included, not
#     only the sources and javadoc jars: the main jar is published too.
#   * Fail closed on an unverifiable scan: `git grep`, `grep` and `unzip` each have their own
#     exit code that does not mean "no hits", and an error there must refuse, not pass.
#
set -uo pipefail
# The scan is always rooted at this repository, EXCEPT when the self-test points it at a
# scratch repository it just built. That override exists so the self-test can exercise this
# script end to end (its real scan function, its real exit code) instead of re-implementing
# the scan next to it and proving only that a regex is a regex. With the RP-1 fix below, a
# `CHECK_PRIVATE_REFERENCES_ROOT` that is not itself a git work tree makes `--tree` refuse
# rather than report clean, so this override can only ever redirect the scan to another real
# git work tree - which is what makes it acceptable to leave in production code.
cd "${CHECK_PRIVATE_REFERENCES_ROOT:-$(dirname "$0")/..}"

# The one definition. Self-non-matching, no exemption anywhere. There is no path exemption
# (the former `internal/**` carve-out protected nothing: this repository has no `internal/`
# directory and by design never will, and the exemption had no self-test case covering it -
# see R-3 in the security review).
