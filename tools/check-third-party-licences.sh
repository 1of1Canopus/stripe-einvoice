# All-of denial pass over ONE module's generated THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt, outside the
# license-maven-plugin allowlist execution (pom.xml, third-party-notices). The plugin's
# <includedLicenses> is an any-of *permission* check: a dependency passes if ANY one of its
# declared licences is on the allowlist, which is the legally correct answer for a genuinely
# dual-licensed artifact (logback: EPL-2.0 OR LGPL-2.1; jakarta.annotation-api: EPL-2.0 OR
# GPL-2.0-with-classpath-exception) but also the wrong answer for a dependency whose POM
# lists two CUMULATIVE licences, e.g. "Apache-2.0 OR GPL-3.0" declared as two licence blocks.
# The plugin has no way to tell the two cases apart; this script is the second pass that does,
# by only ever allowing the exception for a coordinate a human wrote down. See
# the security review's M1/M2/N2/N3/N9/N10 findings.
#
# Never add <excludedLicenses> to the plugin execution instead of this script: it makes the
# build pass AND deletes the GPL-3.0 declaration from the notices file that ships as release
# evidence (M2). The denial pass must run outside the plugin, against the evidence the plugin
# already produced, so a rejected dependency's full licence declaration stays on record.
#
# N1: this script is invoked per module, not once for the whole tree. `pom.xml`'s
# `check-third-party-licences` execution passes two arguments: ${project.build.directory}
# and ${project.packaging}. Running against a tree-wide `find` meant the PARENT module's
# `verify` (which runs first in the reactor, before any module has built) either failed
# closed on a clean checkout - breaking every fresh clone and CI run - or, in a working tree
# with stale target/ directories left from an earlier build, silently validated the PREVIOUS
# build's notices file instead of the current one. Each module now checks only its own.

# Coordinates that are known, by a human, to be genuinely dual-licensed under a permissive
# OR a copyleft term (never both applying at once). An exception is a coordinate, never a
# licence-token pattern: it names precisely which dependency the human accepted. N9: this is
# the ONLY form of exception. There is deliberately no licence-token carve-out (e.g. for
# "classpath-exception") any more - a dependency needing one is admitted here, by a human, by
# coordinate, the same way logback is.
#
# Re-derived for THIS repository's resolved runtime tree on 2026-09-14, never inherited: the
# same list in another product is a carve-out for another dependency tree, and a carve-out
# that is not needed here would sit in the file waiting for a coincidence. Derivation: the
# gate was run over every module's generated THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt with the allowlist
# emptied, and these are exactly the four coordinates it denied, each declaring the Eclipse
# disjunctive pair (the notices line for each is quoted below, from
# stripe-einvoice-spring-boot-starter/target/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt):
#
#   (EPL-2.0) (LGPL-2.1-only) Logback Classic Module (ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.5.38 ...)

#   (EPL-2.0) (GPL2 w/ CPE)   jakarta.transaction API (jakarta.transaction:jakarta.transaction-api:2.0.1 ...)
#
# The fourth (jakarta.transaction-api) is not on the reference product's list; it enters this
# tree through Spring Data JPA. It is the same disjunctive Eclipse shape as
# jakarta.annotation-api, which a human already accepted, and is filed as a QUESTION for the
# record rather than admitted silently.
#
# `--check-unused` (run from CI after a full build, over every module's notices file) fails
# if any entry here was never actually needed, so this list cannot outlive its dependency.

# A SECOND, STRICTLY NARROWER kind of carve-out: a coordinate excused for ONE denied
# pattern and nothing else. ALLOWED_COORDINATES above excuses a coordinate from the whole
# deny list, which is right for a genuinely disjunctive "permissive OR copyleft" licence
# (either term may be chosen, so the permissive one is chosen). Saxon-HE is not that case:
# it is MPL-2.0 and only MPL-2.0, accepted here by an explicit maintainer decision because
# the EN 16931, XRechnung and Peppol schematron are XSLT 2.0 and Saxon-HE is the only
# practical XSLT 2.0 processor for the JVM - without it a default install validates nothing
# and therefore issues nothing.
#
# The scope of that decision is one coordinate and one licence family. An entry is
# "<groupId>:<artifactId>|<pattern>[,<pattern>...]", every pattern being a token from
# DENIED_PATTERNS below. The family needs more than one pattern because a POM writes the
# licence in prose: Saxon-HE 13.0 declares "Mozilla Public License Version 2.0", which
# normalises to a form containing "mozillapubliclicense" but NOT "mpl20", and a neighbouring
# release is free to spell it either way. Listing the family is not a widening: every
# pattern is still bound to this one coordinate. What the entry buys:
#   - a SECOND MPL-licensed dependency still fails the gate (the exception names Saxon-HE,
#     not the licence);
#   - Saxon-HE under any OTHER denied licence still fails (the exception names mpl20, not
#     the coordinate);
#   - net.sf.saxon:Saxon-PE / :Saxon-EE, or a look-alike artifactId, still fail.
# All four are probes in tools/cipher-probe-release-pipeline.sh and self-test cases below.
#
# The invariant that makes this exemption safe, stated rather than implied (checklist line
# 72): MPL-2.0 is a FILE-level copyleft. It obliges us to keep Saxon's own modified files
# under MPL and to say where the source is; it does not reach this project's own source,
# because Saxon is consumed as an unmodified binary dependency across a process boundary of
# our own code. That invariant holds for Saxon-HE consumed unmodified from Maven Central.
# Do not copy this pattern to a dependency whose licence is reciprocal at the WORK level
# (GPL, AGPL, SSPL) - there the same shape of exemption would relicense the product.
#
# `--check-unused` covers these entries too: if Saxon ever leaves the tree, or stops
# declaring MPL, the entry is reported DEAD and the build fails.

# Denied licence tokens (normalised, case-insensitive). Any dependency declaring ANY of
# these among its licences fails, regardless of what else it also declares.
#
# N2: matching used to be done on the raw token - an exact-string match against a handful of
# hyphenated SPDX ids, plus a substring check for the literal letters "gpl". Real POMs write
# prose ("GNU General Public License, version 3"), and prose licence names contain none of
# those substrings, so they passed the denial pass on their permissive half - the exact M1
# hole, respelled. Matching is now done on a NORMALISED form (lowercased, everything that is
# not [a-z0-9] stripped) against both SPDX-id fragments and prose word-patterns, so
# "GPL-3.0", "GPL 3.0", "gplv3", "GPL_3" and "GNU General Public License v3" all normalise to
# a form containing "gpl3" / "generalpubliclicense" and are all denied the same way.
# F4: the bare pattern "mpl" was a substring of ordinary permissive-licence prose and URLs -
# "si-mpl-ified" (Simplified BSD License), "exa-mpl-e" (example.com), "te-mpl-ate",
# "co-mpl-iance" - so a permissive dependency the plugin's own allowlist accepts got DENIED
# here on a false-positive substring hit. Fail-closed, but the failure mode is a red build on
# a licence we ship under ourselves, which is exactly the kind of false alarm that gets a gate
# weakened. Mozilla's own id fragments (mpl11, mpl20, mpl10, mozillapubliclicense) already
# catch every real MPL spelling without the bare substring, so "mpl" is dropped, not replaced.
#
# F5: several copyleft patterns were pinned to one version where the id is not, so a
# neighbouring version walked past the pass while still failing the plugin's own allowlist
# (N2's scenario, respelled): "eupl12" missed "EUPL v1.1" / "EUPL-1.1"; "sspl10" missed a bare
# "SSPL" and "SSPL-2.0". Both are now unpinned ("eupl", "sspl") - neither substring occurs in
# any permissive licence name, so unpinning adds no false positive. OSL-3.0 (Open Software
# License, strong copyleft) and CPAL (Common Public Attribution License) were absent
# entirely and are added.

  # "gpl" as a bare substring catches every SPDX spelling in one go: GPL-1.0/2.0/3.0, every

  # "lgpl" and "agpl" too) LGPL and AGPL in all their versions, with no separate entries
  # needed. It does NOT catch prose that spells the words out without the letters "g", "p",
  # "l" running together ("GNU General Public License" has no contiguous "gpl") - that is

#
# N3: the coordinate is read from the LAST "(...)" group on the line, never the first. The
# earlier version took the first `(group:artifact:version - url)`-shaped group with a
# non-greedy match, and a dependency's own POM <name> is free text that lands on the SAME
# line, BEFORE its real coordinate - a dependency named
# "evil (ch.qos.logback:logback-core:1.5.6 - http://x)" was read as logback-core (on the
# coordinate allowlist) and skipped entirely, licences unchecked. The notices format always
# places the real coordinate last, so the last paren group is the one that is trusted, and
# its content is validated against the g:a:v shape (version now allowing `+`, in addition to
# `.` and `-`, since Maven versions legally contain it) before being trusted as a coordinate.
#
# F2: [^()]* cannot span a nested pair, so a dependency's own project <url> - free text on the
# same line, inside the coordinate group - could contain a balanced "(...)" and make the
# scanner return that INNER group as the "last" one, dropping the real (outer) coordinate.
# Scanning is now depth-aware: it walks the line character by character, tracking paren
# depth, and collects only DEPTH-1 ("top-level") groups - a group whose own parens are never
# nested inside another paren the rest of the line owns. The last top-level group is the one
# trusted as the coordinate, exactly as before, but a nested pair inside it (a URL's own
# "(bar)") is now part of that group's content instead of splitting it into two. The line is
# additionally required to END with the closing ")" of that last top-level group; anything
# trailing it is not a valid notices line and falls to UNPARSEABLE (fail closed, as today). A
# legitimate URL with a balanced pair, e.g. ".../wiki/Foo_(bar)", now parses cleanly instead
# of tripping UNPARSEABLE and the count check as it did under the old flat scan.
#
# A line that starts like a dependency line (a leading run of "(...)" groups) but whose last
# top-level paren group does not parse as a coordinate is NOT skipped - it is printed as
