# Proves the build is reproducible: the same source tree, built twice, produces
# byte-identical jars for the two published artifacts.
#
#   scripts/verify-reproducible.sh
#
# How it works. Both builds are run with -Dproject.build.outputTimestamp set to the
# committer date of HEAD, so every zip entry carries that instant instead of "now".
# The jars from the first build are copied aside, the tree is rebuilt from clean, and
# the SHA-256 of each jar is compared.
#
# The two builds are invoked differently ON PURPOSE. Build 1 skips tests: it is the fast
# baseline whose checksums get written to disk and later compared against what actually
# got deployed. Build 2 runs the tests, because `clean deploy -Prelease` (the invocation
# that publishes) runs the tests too, and a surefire report or any other test-only byte
# landing in a jar is exactly the defect this script exists to catch (see run 34419387032:
# a `-DskipTests` vs `-DskipTests`
# comparison agreed the sources jars were reproducible while the real, tests-running release
# build produced a sources jar with surefire-reports/ baked in). A flaky test now fails this
# script before anything is deployed, which is where this pipeline wants that failure.
#
# Checked (must match):
#   stripe-einvoice-core-<v>.jar
#   stripe-einvoice-core-<v>-sources.jar
#   stripe-einvoice-spring-boot-starter-<v>.jar
#   stripe-einvoice-spring-boot-starter-<v>-sources.jar
#   stripe-einvoice-core-<v>.pom
#   stripe-einvoice-spring-boot-starter-<v>.pom
#   stripe-einvoice-parent-<v>.pom
#
# Poms are checked for the same reason the jars are: Central consumes the pom bytes too,
# and the window between this proved build and the upload applies to them identically
# (RP-5). Signatures are correctly left out - they are not reproducible.
#
# The parent pom (RP-6) is recorded too: the bundle carries exactly three published
# coordinates - parent, core, starter - and a record covering only two of them leaves the
# third an unrecorded bundle entry on every release, which is what broke the comparison
# step (see release.yml's own fix, same finding).
#
# Reported but NOT enforced: the javadoc jars. javadoc embeds the JDK build string and,
# in some JDK versions, generation-time detail that -notimestamp does not remove. Maven
# Central requires a javadoc jar; nobody diffs one.
#
# Also writes a checksum file, "<sha256>  <filename>" per jar from build 1 (the two
# builds already matched by the time this is written, or the script has already exited
# non-zero). This is what L1 compares the actually-deployed jars against after
# `clean deploy`, so a reproducible tree is not just proved in the abstract, it is proved
# to be what got published. Written OUTSIDE target/ by default (target/*.jar is what
# `mvn clean deploy` deletes and rebuilds next, a third time, right after this script
# runs) - override with REPRODUCIBLE_SHA_FILE to put it somewhere that survives that
# clean, e.g. $RUNNER_TEMP in CI.
